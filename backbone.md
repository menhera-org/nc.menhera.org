## MTU sizes
Our network is interconnected with tunneling technologies.

* There is some links in Menhera.org's network backbone with MTU sizes as small as 1400.
* (For Menhera.org users) Internal intranet links are encrypted, so they have MTU sizes varying from 1280 to 1372.
* In whatever case, MTU is never smaller than 1280, the IPv6 limit.
